# Hello-World
 Github Tutorial Repository for OCN F303
test?
I'm making sure I'm using this feature correctly.
Since it's working, I'll give some information about myself since that's what it says in the tutorial.
My name is Elias Leigh Reynolds, I'm 19 and turning 20 years old on December 24th, 2023.
I've wanted to be a marine biologist since I was 11, and I've found a new passion in parasites and diseases specifically. Genetics too! Though I guess those aren't mutually exclusive. 
Outside of marine science, I love to cook, create artwork, and garden.
